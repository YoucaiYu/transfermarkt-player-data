# transfermarkt-player-data

In the Seminar_2018 the crawler will get all club-information of five leagues of europe, which could be used later to get all players' data, such as age and position, of each season from 2013 to 2017.

The player_performance_data.py will get the goal keepers' performance data and the normal_player_performance_data.py will get performance data of players from other positions.
